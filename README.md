# adventure-journal

This is my First experience with git basg and github!

The exercise was:

Exercise Objectives
1. Create a new Git repository.
2. Clone the repository locally.
3. Create a new branch.
4. Create a file using bash.
5. Populate the file with text using bash.
6. Use various Git commands (git status, git log, git checkout, git diff,
git add, git commit, git log, git push) to manage the project.
7. Create another new branch and add more content using bash.
Step-by-Step Scenarios
Scenario 1: Starting the Adventure Journal
You and your team have decided to start a new project to document your expedition. Begin by
creating a new repository named adventure-journal on GitHub (or any Git hosting
service). Once created, clone this repository to your local machine to start working on it.
Scenario 2: Documenting the First Discovery
After cloning the repository, you decide to document the first significant discovery. Create a new
branch named initial-discovery for this purpose.
Scenario 3: Creating the Journal File
On the initial-discovery branch, create a file named journal.txt using bash. This
file will contain a list of significant events, discoveries, and observations during the expedition.
Scenario 4: Recording the First Event
Use bash to populate the journal.txt file with details about the first discovery. Include the
date, location, and any notable observations.
Scenario 5: Preparing for Team Review
Check the status of your working directory to see the changes youâ€™ve made and ensure
everything is ready before sharing it with your team.
Scenario 6: Reviewing Journal Entries
Review the changes made to the journal.txt file before committing them to the repository.
This will help you ensure the accuracy of the documented events.
Scenario 7: Staging Journal Entries
Stage the journal.txt file for commit. This step is crucial for tracking changes in the
repository and preparing the file for a commit.
Scenario 8: Committing the Journal Entries
Commit your changes with a meaningful message explaining the details of the first discovery
that were added to the journal. This message will be useful for other team members to
understand the updates.
Scenario 9: Reviewing Commit History
Check the commit history to ensure your changes are properly recorded. This will help you keep
track of the project's progress over time.
Scenario 10: Sharing the Journal with the Team
Push your branch to the remote repository. This allows other team members to see your
contributions and collaborate further on the adventure journal.
Scenario 11: Adding a New Observation
Create a new branch named new-observation for adding more content. On this branch,
create a new file named observation.txt using bash and add details about a new
observation. This file should include the date, time, and a detailed description of the
observation.
Scenario 12: Preparing and Committing the New Observation
Repeat the process of checking the status, reviewing changes, staging the file, committing the
changes with a meaningful message, and pushing the new branch to the remote reposit

here is the implementation!
